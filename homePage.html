                    Oceania where there are no existing wild populations,
                    they are widely distributed in parts of the northern and southern hemispheres.
                    Common features are large body, strong limbs, long nose, thick hair, short tail, plantar feet, and
                    five curved, sharp, non-retractable claws on each paw.
